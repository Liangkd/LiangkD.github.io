Hi! I’m **Kaidi Liang**, a PhD student at **Stony Brook University**.

My research interests include:
- **Traffic accident understanding** and **temporal localization**
- **Multimodal large language models (MLLMs)** for video reasoning
- **Traffic safety** and intelligent transportation systems

Currently, I am working on **CrashChat**, a multitask framework for traffic crash video analysis.
