Hi! I’m **Kaidi Liang**, a PhD student at **Stony Brook University**.

My research focuses on:
- **Multimodal large language models (MLLMs)** for traffic safety and autonomous driving
- **End-to-end autonomous driving systems**, including **perception, planning, control, and testing**
- **System-level evaluation** of autonomous driving technologies on transportation infrastructure and road network efficiency

Currently, my colleagues and I are developing **CrashChat**, a multitask framework that leverages MLLMs for **traffic crash video analysis**, aiming to comprehensively understand accident scenarios and support **early risk anticipation and avoidance**.

If you have ideas, questions, or are interested in potential collaborations, feel free to reach out.
